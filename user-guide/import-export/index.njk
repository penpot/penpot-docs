<h1 id="importing">Import and export files</h1>
<p class="main-paragraph">You can export Penpot files to your computer and import them from your computer to your projects.</p>

<p class="advice">Importing files from other tools and services are among the main priorities of the Penpot team. Related features are coming soon.</p>

<h3 id="importing-export">Export Penpot files</h3>
<p>Exporting files is useful If you want to share Penpot files with a user that does not belong to one of your teams or you want to have a backup of your files outside penpot.app.</p>
<p>To export a file select the export option from the file menu at the dashboard and a .penpot file will be downloaded to your computer.</p>

<h4>Export multiple files</h4>

<h4>Exporting files linked to Shared libraries</h4>
<p>Exported files linked to shared libraries provide different ways to export their assets. Choose the one that suits you better!</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Export shared libraries</strong>: Files with shared libraries will be included in the export, maintaining their linkage.</li>
  <li><strong>Include shared library assets in file libraries</strong>: Files will be exported with all external assets merged into the file library.</li>
  <li><strong>Treat shared library assets as basic objects</strong>: Shared libraries will not be included in the export and no assets will be added to the library.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose the one that suits you better for each occasion!</p>

<p>Before actually importing the files to your project, you’ll still have the chance to change their names or get rid of unwanted files.</p>

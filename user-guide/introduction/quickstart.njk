<p class="main-paragraph">You can start using Penpot right in your browser or installing it in a server of your own.</p>

<h3>In the browser</h3>
<p>To use Penpot online point your browser to <a href="https://design.penpot.app" target="_blank">design.penpot.app</a> and start designing. Use the latest Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox for the best experience. We also provide specific support to WebKit (Safari / Epiphany).</p>
<p>You simply go to <a href="https://penpot.app" target="_blank">penpot.app</a> and click on the Signup button. You will be asked to create an account. We only ask for an email. There are some authentication providers available, too.</p>

<h3>On my own server</h3>
<p>Current private Penpot instances are only requiring basic Docker knowledge.</p>
<p>You can run your own Penpot server following these instructions: <a href="https://help.penpot.app/technical-guide/developer/">help.penpot.app/technical-guide/developer/</a></p>

<h1 id="layer-basics">Layer basics</h1>
<p class="main-paragraph">Every object you create at Penpot’s workspace is a layer. Rectangles, ellipses, artboards or texts are some types of layers that you can use to build your designs.</p>


<h3 id="pages">Pages</h3>
<p>Pages allows you to organize your layers in separate tabs inside a file. Subdividing a file gives you options to make better sense of your work. For instance, you can use them to separate different stages of the design process in the same document. Screen sizes, features or atomic design categories are other common ways to use pages. </p>
<p>You can add, remove or rename pages to suit your needs.</p>

<h3 id="layers-panel">Layers panel</h3>
<p>At the layers panel you can see all the layers of a file page. Drag the layers to arrange them to different positions.</p>

<h3 id="hide-lock">Hide and lock layers</h3>
<p>Click on the eye icon to change the visibility of a layer. Click on the lock icon to lock or unlock a layer. A locked layer can not be modified.</p>

<h3 id="creating-layers">Creating layers</h3>
<p>To create a layer you have to select the type of layer by clicking the selected tool (artboard, rectangle, ellipse, text, image, path or curve) at the toolbar. Then you usually have to click and drag your mouse on the viewport. </p>
<p>Hold <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd> while creating an ellipse or a rectangle to maintain equal width and height.</p>

<h3 id="duplicating-layers">Duplicating layers</h3>
<p>There are several ways to duplicate a layer:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You can press <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> to duplicate a layer right over a selected layer. </li>
  <li>If you press right click over a selected layer at the viewport or at the layers panel you can use the option at the layer menu. </li>
  <li>You can also select a layer and drag while pressing <kbd>Alt/⌥</kbd> so you can simultaneously duplicate and drag the new layer.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/img/layer-duplicate.gif" alt="duplicating layers" /></p>


<h3 id="delete-layers">Deleting layers</h3>
<p>There are a couple ways to delete a layer. </p>
<ol>
  <li>You can press <kbd>Supr/⌫</kbd> to delete a selected layer. </li>
  <li>If you press right click over a selected layer at the viewport or at the layers panel you can use the option at the layer menu.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/img/layer-delete.gif" alt="delete layers" /></p>


<h3 id="select-layers">Selecting layers</h3>
<p>The simplest way to select a layer is to click on it. Make sure that you have the “move” pointer selected at the toolbar. </p>
<p>To select multiple layers you can click and drag around the layers you want to select. You can also click more than one layer while pressing <kbd>Shift/⇧</kbd>. If you hold <kbd>Shift/⇧</kbd> and click you can deselect layers individually.</p>

<h4>Selecting layers at the layers panel</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Click a layer to do a single selection.</li>
  <li>Press <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd> while clicking two or more layers to do a multiple selection.</li>
  <li>If you press <kbd>Shift/⇧</kbd> while selecting two or more layers all the layers within the selection area will be selected.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/img/layers-selecting-2.gif" alt="layers select" /></p>
<h4>Selecting layers ignoring groups</h4>
<p>If you want to select an element that is difficult to reach because is under a group of elements, hold <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd> to make the selection ignore group areas and treat all the objects as being at the same level.</p>

<h3 id="grouping-layers">Grouping layers</h3>
<p>Grouped layers can be moved, transformed or styled at the same time. To group two or more layers you have to select them and then press <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd>. You can also use the option at the layers menu that you can open with right click.</p>
<p>To <strong>ungroup</strong> press <kbd>Shift/⇧</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> or use the option at the layers menu that you can open with right click over the group. </p>
<p>To <strong>select a layer inside a group</strong> you do double click. First click selects the group, second click selects a layer.</p>

<h3 id="masking-layers">Masking layers</h3>
<p>A mask is a layer that does a clipping and only shows parts of a layer or multiple layers that fall within its shape. </p>
<p>To mask layers you first have to select more than one layer or a group of them. Then you can apply the masking using the option at the layers menu or by pressing <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd>. The shape that is at the lowest level at the layer list will be used as a mask. </p>
<p>To <strong>unmask</strong> press <kbd>Shift/⇧</kbd> + <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> or use the option at the layers menu.</p>

<h3 id="moving-layers">Moving layers</h3>
<p>To move one or more layers on the viewport you have to select them first and then click and drag the selection where you want to place them. You can also use the design panel to set a precise position relative to the viewport or the artboard.</p>
<p><img src="/img/layers-moving.gif" alt="Moving layers" /></p>



<h3 id="resizing-layers">Resizing layers</h3>
<p>To resize a selected layer you can use the handles at the edges of the selection box. Make sure the cursor is in resizing mode. If you hold <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd> while resizing the object will preserve its current proportions. You can also use the design panel where you can link width and height.</p>
<p><img src="/img/layers-resizing.gif" alt="layers" /></p>



<h3 id="rotating-layers">Rotating layers</h3>
<p>To rotate selected layers you can use the handlers at the edges of the selection box. Make sure the cursor is in rotation mode. If you hold <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd> while rotation the angle will change in 45 degree increments. You can also find this option at the design panel.</p>
<p><img src="/img/layers-rotating.gif" alt="layers" /></p>


<h3 id="flipping-layers">Flipping layers</h3>
<p>To flip a layer <strong>horizontally</strong> press <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd>. To flip a layer <strong>vertically</strong> press <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>. You can also find these actions at the layers menu.</p>
<p><img src="/img/layers-flipping.gif" alt="layers flipping" /></p>


<h3 id="">Aligning and distributing layers</h3>
<p>Aligning and distributing layers can be found at the top of the Design panel. </p>
<p><strong>Aligning</strong> will move all the selected layers layers to a position relative to one of them. For instance aligning top will align the elements with the edge of the top-most element.</p>
<p><img src="/img/layers-align.gif" alt="layers" /></p>
<p><strong>Distributing</strong> objects allows you to position them vertically and horizontally with equal distances between them.</p>

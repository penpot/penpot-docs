<h1 id="components">Components</h1>
<p class="main-paragraph">Speed your workflow with the reusable power of components.</p>
<p>A component is an object or group of objects that can be reused multiple times across files (projects and teams in the future). All copies of a component used in files are linked. That is, any update made to the Main component is reflected in all component copies (if you accept the update) . You can even create overrides for specific parts of component copies.</p>

<p>A component has two parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Main component</strong> - This is the source that defines the component. Main components exist only in the library, not in the viewport.</li>
  <li><strong>Component Copy</strong> or instance. These are copies of a Main component that has been placed in the viewport. Component copies are linked to their Main component.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="component-create">Create a Component</h3>
<p>To create a component:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select an object or a group of them.</li>
  <li>Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> or right click and select the option “Create component” at the object menu.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="component-folder">Create a Folder for Your Components</h3>
<p>To create subfolders in your component library, use slashes (/):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a component.</li>
  <li>Rename the component as follows: "FOLDER NAME/COMPONENT NAME". For example, "Buttons/Alert Button".</li>
  <li>To rename the folder or ungroup the items, right-click on the folder's name.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="component-update">Update main components</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Make a change in a component copy.</li>
  <li>Right click and select the option “Update main component” at the component menu.</li>
</ol>

<p>If a file is using a component from a Shared library that has been updated, a notification will be shown offering the options for update or dismiss.</p>

<h3 id="component-overrides">Component Overrides</h3>
<p>Overrides are modifications made in a specific copy that are not in its main component. With overrides you can keep changes at the component copies while maintaining synchronization with the Main component.</p>
<p>Component layers with overrides are marked with a “*” at the layers list.</p>

<h4>Reset overrides</h4>
<p>Right click and select the option “Reset overrides” at the component menu to get it to the state of the Main component.</p>

<h3 id="component-detach">Detach Instance</h3>
<p>Detach a component copy to unlink it from its Main component will transform it in a group layer. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> or right click and select the option “Detach instance” at the component menu.</p>
<p>You can also detach components in bulk by selecting several components and performing the same action.</p>

<h3 id="component-show">Show main component</h3>
<p>To easily locate the Main component of a component copy there is the option at the component menu “Show main component” that will open the library where the Main component belongs.</p>

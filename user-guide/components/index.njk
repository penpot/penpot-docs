<h1 id="components">Components</h1>
<p class="main-paragraph">Speed your workflow with the reusable power of components.</p>
<p>A component is an object or group of objects that can be reused multiple times across user files (projects and teams in the future). All copies of a component used in user files are linked. That is, any update made to the Main component is reflected in all component copies (if you accept the update) . You can even create overrides for specific parts of component copies.</p>

<p>A component has two aspects:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Main component</strong> is the source that defines the component. Main components exist only in the library, not in the viewport.</li>
  <li><strong>Component copy</strong> or instance, is a copy of the Main component that is placed at the viewport. Component copies are linked to their Main component.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="component-create">Create a component</h3>

<h3 id="component-update">Update main components</h3>

<p>If a file is using a component from a Shared library that has been updated, a notification will be shown offering the options for update or dismiss.</p>

<h3 id="component-overrides">Component overrides</h3>
<p>Overrides are differences at the copy components from their main components. With overrides you can keep changes at the component copies while maintaining synchronization with the Main component.</p>
<p>Component layers with overrides are marked with a “*” at the layers list.</p>

<h4>Reset overrides</h4>
<p>Right click and select the option “Reset overrides” at the component menu to get it to the state of the Main component.</p>

<h3 id="component-detach">Detach instance</h3>
<p>Detach a component copy to unlink it from its Main component by transforming it in a group layer. Right click and select the option “Detach instance” at the component menu.</p>

<h3 id="component-show">Show main component</h3>
<p>To easily show the Main component of a component copy there is the option at the component menu “Show main component” that will open the library where the component belongs.</p>

<p class="main-paragraph">Bug hunting is not difficult if you know how.</p>

<h3 id="reporting-bugs-howto">How to report a bug</h3>

<p>We are using <a href="https://github.com/penpot/penpot/issues" target="_blank">GitHub Issues</a> for our public bugs. We keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesn't already exist.</p>

<p>If you found a bug, please report it, as far as possible including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a detailed explanation of steps to reproduce the error.</li>
  <li>a browser and the browser version used.</li>
  <li>a dev tools console exception stack trace (if it is available).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you found a bug that you' woul'd rather discuss in private (for example: security bugs), consider first send an email to <a href="mailto:info@penpot.app">info@penpot.app</a>.</p>

<p><strong>We don't have formal bug bounty program for security reports; this is an open source application and your contribution will be recognized in the changelog.</strong></p>

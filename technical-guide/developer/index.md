# Developer Guide

This section is intended for people wanting to mess with the
code. The [Dev Env][1] section explains how to setup the common
development enviroment that we (the core team) use internally.

The rest of sections are a list categorized of probably not deeply
related HOWTO articles about dev-centric subjects.

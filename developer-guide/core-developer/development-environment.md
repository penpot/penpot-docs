# Development environment

## System requirements

You should have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed in your system
in order to set up properly the development enviroment.

In debian like linux distributions you can install it executing:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker docker-compose
```

Start and enable docker environment:


```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

Add your user to the docker group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

And finally, increment user watches:

```
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```

NOTE: you probably need to login again for group change take the effect.


## Start the devenv

**Requires a minimum knowledge of tmux usage in order to use that
development environment.**

For start it, staying in this repository, execute:

```bash
./manage.sh pull-devenv
./manage.sh run-devenv
```

This will do the following:

- Pulls the latest devenv image.
- Starts all the containers in the background.
- Attaches to the **devenv** container and executes the tmux session.
- The tmux session automatically starts all the necessary services.

You can execute the individual steps manully if you want:

```bash
./manage.sh build-devenv # builds the devenv docker image (not necessary in normal sircumstances)
./manage.sh start-devenv # starts background running containers
./manage.sh run-devenv   # enters to new tmux session inside of one of the running containers
./manage.sh stop-devenv  # stops background running containers
./manage.sh drop-devenv  # removes all the volumes, containers and networks used by the devenv
```

Now having the the container running and tmux open inside the
container, you are free to execute any commands and open many shells
as you want.

You can create a new shell just pressing the **Ctr+b c** shortcut. And
**Ctrl+b w** for switch between windows, **Ctrl+b &** for kill the
current window.

### Inside the tmux session

#### gulp

The styles and many related tasks are executed thanks to gulp and they are
executed in the tmux **window 0**. This is a normal gulp watcher with some
additional tasks.


#### shadow-cljs

The frontend build process is located on the tmux **window 1**.
**Shadow-cljs** is used for build and serve the frontend code. For
more information, please refer to `02-Frontend-Developer-Guide.md`.

By default the **window 1** executes the shadow-cljs watch process,
that starts a new JVM/Clojure instance if there is no one running.

Finally, you can start a REPL linked to the instance and the current
connected browser, by opening a third window with `Ctrl+c` and running
`npx shadow-cljs cljs-repl main`.


#### exporter

The exporter app (clojurescript app running in nodejs) is located in
**window 2**, and you can go directly to it using `ctrl+b 2` shortcut.

There you will found the window split in two slices. On the top slice
you will have the build process (using shadow-cljs in the same way as
frontend application), and on the bot slice the script that launeches
the node process.

If some reason scripts does not stars correctly, you can manually
execute `node target/app.js ` to start the exporter app.


#### backend

The backend related environment is located in the tmux **window 3**,
and you can go directly to it using `ctrl+b 2` shortcut.

By default the backend will be started in non-interactive mode for
convenience but you can just press `Ctrl+c` and execute `./scripts/repl`
for start the repl.

On the REPL you have this helper functions:
- `(start)`: start all the environment
- `(stop)`: stops the environment
- `(restart)`: stops, reload and start again.

And many other that are defined in the `dev/user.clj` file.

If some exception is raised when code is reloaded, just use
`(repl/refresh-all)` in order to finish correctly the code swaping and
later use `(restart)` again.

For more information, please refer to: `03-Backend-Guide.md`.

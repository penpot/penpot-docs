# Core developer guide

This is a generic "getting started" guide for the Penpot platform. It
intends to explain how to get the development environment up and
running with many additional tips.

The main development environment consists in a docker compose
configuration that starts the external services and the development
container (called **devenv**).

We use tmux script in order to multiplex the single terminal and run
both the backend and frontend in the same container.
